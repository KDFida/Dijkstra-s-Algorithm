# NEA - Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

Implementation of dijkstra's algorithm from one location in a building to another location within a building. During my time at College I realised new students struggled to find their way around the building, this inspired me to write a program for my A Level Computer Science Non-Exam Assessment, that would guide new students, new staff or visitors around the College.
